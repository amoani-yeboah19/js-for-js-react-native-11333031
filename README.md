-Task 1
The task is to write a Node.js module with a processedArray function located in an arrayManipulation.js file. An array of numbers is given to the processedArray funcion, which squares any even number and tripples any odd number to produce a new array. Using the map method, the function iterates accross the input array, applying the alteration to each element according to its parity. The function then output the changed array back to the caller.
-Task 2
The task involves creating a function called formatArrayStrings in arrayManipulation.js that takes two arrays as input: one containing strings and the other containing numbers. The function should check if the two input arrays are of equal length and then format each string in the strings array based on the corresponding number in the numbers array. If the number is even, the string should be converted to uppercase; if the number is odd, the string should be converted to lowercase. The function should return a new array with the modified strings.
-Task 3
Creating a function in the userInfo.js file named createUserProfiles was the work at hand. The names and modifiedNames arrays are the two inputs used by this function. It generates user profiles with both the original and changed names across the names array, as well as auto-incremented ids for every profile. A collection of user profiles is returned by the function. The id values assigned to every profile are tracked using the nextId variable.
